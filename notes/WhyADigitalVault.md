# Preface
Why would anyone want a digital vault? That's something that I never asked myself until about 27 hours ago when a supervisor at my co-op told me that he stores all of his files in easily accessible formats so they aren't tied to a specific provider, like Microsoft. Here, I'll talk a bit about what he told me, and then my own thoughts on "digital vaults" and "owning your data".

# Supervisor Teachings
In this world, lots of data is tied to a specific format. For example, `.docx` files are intrinsically tied to Microsoft. My supervisor talked about how when it comes to data, in order to know that you own it and will be able to properly access it years or decades into the future, it needs to be in a simple format that isn't tied to an external source. The best file format is one that you could have read 10 years ago with no problem, as well as decades into the future. And this makes sense to me, as it hopefully does to anyone reading this. A text file is simple, it contains text and there's nothing fancy going on. I would hope that a text file in the past and future will require no external sources to view it, but rather any file viewer that you can get literally anywhere. The same goes with Markdown, which is why my supervisor said he takes all of his notes in it. 

Another point I want to mention here is that he talked about more than just files, but really anything that runs locally and is not dependent on someone or something else. For example, (this is not an ad) Obsidian helps manage markdown files, and it's what I'm currently trying out myself since it's fully local. Another one is SQLite which I haven't gotten to trying, but I was told how my supervisor stores all his data in SQLite so it's local and easy to retrieve.

**Overall, by using these basic file formats, you own your data, and it can never be found in an unreadable format or taken away from you.** Obviously, there's more to it, like you need to store it locally. But the general gist is that using basic formats means you own it, and it will always remain yours.

# My thoughts
When it comes to owning data, I really like the idea. It sucks, especially as a software developer, being dependent on someone else's software that might change and render your own work obsolete. While I haven't had this happen in terms of my files, I also haven't owned my files for long enough and gone back to old ones to notice a difference. Even so, the romantic part of me likes the idea that it's mine and only mine. Everything I have on Google Drive may be mine, but it can easily be taken away if I lose my password. Technically speaking, this can too if I lose my computer, but that's why I plan to put this on Github so at least there's a remote and local version in case one fails.

What I also like is how portable markdown is. It isn't dependent on a specific company's software (we assume basic markdown, not the fact that markdown in git displays differently from bitbucket because they have their own rules), and it can be displayed anywhere. It also enriches text beyond what text files can show you. It's become a staple in the world of programming from what I can tell, and I quite like that. 

Anyways, overall I'm trying not to feel too much like a sheep following what the more experienced sheep told me, so that's part of why I wanted to write my thoughts down. I like the idea behind the owning data philosophy, I like exploring new tools such as Obsidian and SQLite which are completely local, and I like writing something I may look back at in the future that makes me smile.

While I'm not sure if anyone will find this on my Github and read the full thing, if you have, good for you! You've officially read the first installment in one man's ramblings, his raw thoughts from brain to markdown, and have hopefully learned something from it.
