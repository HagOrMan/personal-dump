# Things to Ask in Interviews / Coffee 
Some random thoughts I had on questions I might want to ask as general good-to-knows from people with a good perspective:  
- Do you prioritize playing to your strengths or improving on your weaknesses? If you had to choose one that was more important (for yourself, this role, this company/team, personal growth), which would it be and why?
  - For this, I think I got a pretty good answer already about it being important which ones are more valued. Don't base it on what you're good at but where the value add can come from.
- How do you define success?
- In a constantly changing field, what do you/company do to stay up to date?
- If you had to prioritize speed (quantity of work done) or quality, which would it be, and why? What is your preferred balance?
  - Very situational and should emphasize that you aren't asking in general, since different jobs require different speeds, but specific to the "average" speed of their own work.
