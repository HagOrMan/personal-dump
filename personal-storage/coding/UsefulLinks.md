# Design
## Canva Colour Wheel
Canva colour wheel providing complimentary, monochromatic, analogous, etc., colour combinations on a couler picker, and explaining all of colour theory: https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/

## Tailwind CSS Colour Generator (Radix does it better now)
Generates all of your tailwind colours of stuff like `blue-50` to `blue-950` and provides a clean look at what that colour palette would look like on a website in both light and dark mode: https://uicolors.app/create

## All Radix Info
### Radix Icons
https://www.radix-ui.com/icons

### Radix Colours
An amazingly done colour system which describes all of the colours, what belongs in a background, interactive component, border, etc: https://www.radix-ui.com/colors

### Radix Colour Generator (new favourite since Tailwind CSS Colour Generator went paid for multiple colours)
Gives a nice UI and lets you see different colours on screen together, building a harmonious colour palette: https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/custom

### Palette Composition Help
Shows all of the palette scales that Radix has: https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/scales  

Teaches you how to compose your own palette: https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette

# Frontend
## Tailwind
### Hover, Focus, and other States
Nice descriptions of how to use tailwind with different states and shows how to make it look good: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states

# APIs
## Public API List
A collaborative list of 1400+ APIs for developers: https://publicapis.dev/

## Rapid API (free APIs and paid marketplace for other APIs)
RapidAPI was used during my work for a custom web scrapped information API, and many amazing APIs in it have free versions with limits where you only pay if you want to upgrade your plan: https://rapidapi.com/hub  
(it looks like they also got acquired by Nokia so I'm curious if the business model will change at all)

# Graphing and Data Analysis
## Python Graph Gallery
A link of tons of graphs made in python (often with dependencies like Matplotlib), and how to make them. Very good for inspiration when looking for different graphs you could use for visualizing information, even if you aren't going to use python: https://python-graph-gallery.com/

# New Tools
## Math Animations
An animation engine for explanatory math videos using programs: https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/
